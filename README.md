## Tags 

This is the format for paragraphs: `<p></p>`
- If I want to add a line break into the `<p>` tag, some `<br>` tags are needed inside the `<p>` Example: `<p>First <br> Second </p>`
- The headings are important to show the hierarchy, from `<h1>` to `<h6>`, and these will take the standard values of the browser.
- The major browsers use a 16px measurement for 1em, depending on the body hierarchy size.

**Text Formatting:**

- Bold Text: `<p>First <b>Bold</b></p>`
- Important Text: `<p>First <strong>Important</strong></p>`
- Italic Text: `<p>First <i>Italic text</i></p>`
- Emphasized Text: `<p>First <em>Italic text</em></p>`
- Underlined Text: `<p>First <u>Underlined text</u></p>`
- Inserted Text: `<p>First <ins>Inserted text</ins></p>`
- Smaller Text: `<p>First <small>Smaller text</small></p>`
- Bigger Text: `<p>First <big>Bigger text</big></p>`
- Subscript Text: `<p>First <sub>Subscript text</sub></p>`
- Superscript Text: `<p>First <sup>Superscript text</sup></p>`
- Marked Text: `<p>First <mark>Marked text</mark></p>`
- Deleted Text: `<p>First <del>Deleted text</del></p>`

**Links:**

For the links, we can use the following structure:
```html
<a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank" title="This is a title from the tag">This is a simple text inside an anchor text</a>
